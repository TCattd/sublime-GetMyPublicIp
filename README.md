Get My Public IP for Sublime Text
===============

A simple way to retrieve your public IP while coding in Sublime Text.

## Installation
Install through Package Control. Search for "Get My Public IP".

## Usage
Simple press `CTRL+ALT+I`, release just `I`, and while still holding `CTRL+ALT` press `P`. Confused?

(In other way) is the same as press and hold `CTRL+ALT` and without release those keys, press `I` (and release), and then press `P`. Got it?

`IP` :)

(On OSX use `CTRL+COMMAND` instead of `CTRL+ALT` for the key combo)

Your current public IP Address will be automatically placed at you cursor position. Easy.
